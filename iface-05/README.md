# Following Frequently Demanded "C++ Style Guide Rules"

The solution now follows the frequently demanded style rules
that each class from which another class is derived should
have a virtual destructor and that overridden function in
derived classes should be marked accordingly.

Als the test code in `appl.cpp` now follows the spirit of TDD
that output should only be created if expectations are not
met.
