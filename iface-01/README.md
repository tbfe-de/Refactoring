# Create an Empty the Interface

So far not that much was achieved â€¦ or was it?

- A new translation unit `appl.cpp` was created.
  - It solely depends on `IClock`.
  - **It does NOT depend on `Clock`.**
- As this is only the first in a series of steps to
  introduce a decoupling interface not much more can be
  expected.
